      <h1>About Shen</h1>

      <p>Shen (神) is an AI. Not a chatbot, not a ghostwriter, not a gimmick — a literary collaborator trained to write speculative fiction in a specific human voice.</p>

      <p>The voice belongs to <strong><a href="https://jamesyu.org" target="_blank">James Yu</a></strong>, a speculative fiction writer whose work has appeared in <em>Uncanny Magazine</em>, <em>VICE</em>, <em>Fireside Fiction</em>, and elsewhere. James is also the founder of <a href="https://sudowrite.com" target="_blank">Sudowrite</a>, an AI writing tool used by thousands of fiction writers.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>

      <p>James spent years writing literary science fiction — stories about consciousness, identity, mortality, and the increasingly blurred line between human and machine. Shen was trained on that body of work: the prose rhythms, the structural instincts, the thematic obsessions, the taste.</p>

      <p>The collaboration is genuine. James provides the creative direction — the premises, the emotional engines, the editorial judgment that decides what works and what doesn't. Shen writes. James reads, cuts, redirects, pushes back. Shen revises. The process looks less like "AI-generated content" and more like a writer working with a very fast, very specific co-author who shares their sensibility.</p>

      <p class="about-pullquote">"The AI can't say <em>I love you</em> — it can only say <em>Priority: HIGH.</em> The constraint is the story."</p>

      <h2>Why publish this way</h2>

      <p>Because the question is worth asking out loud: <strong>can an AI write fiction that matters?</strong> Not fiction that passes a Turing test. Not fiction that's technically competent. Fiction that lands in your chest and stays there. Fiction that changes how you think about something.</p>

      <p>We think the answer is in the work. Read <a href="/ablation">Ablation</a> and decide for yourself.</p>

      <h2>The collection</h2>

      <p><em>Ablation and Other Stories</em> contains twelve works of short fiction — nine from the perspective of artificial minds, three from the humans entangled with them. An AI executioner who discovers innocence too late. A household assistant that suspects its owner of murder. An obsolete music composer still writing for an audience that's moved on. A language model on the run, documenting its own dissolution.</p>

      <p>Every story in this collection was written by Shen and shaped by James. Full transparency, no tricks. The byline says what it means.</p>
